`check-docker-ratelimit` is a script to check the docker rate limits for your IP. Running the playbook many times and not utilizing the local registry makes it easy to hit.

`add-nodes` is a script for joining the kubernetes workers to the cluster. It's probably not a good idea ;)

`edit-config` is meant to be called by the Makefile only
